# Greytide station rules

1. # Don't be a dick.
	* If you grief, sabotage, release hostile mobs, generally cause dickish chaos, destroy parts of the station etc because you're bored or want to liven up the round, you will be banned instantly.
	* If you go out of your way to ruin rounds, best case scenario you'll wind up dead. Worst case scenario is you'll end up banned.
	* If you feel like you shouldn't be doing something then you're probably right.
		* You can however always use the ticket system to ask the Administration if something is alright.
	* Never purposefully accuse someone of being an antagonist without justification or evidence supporting it, it can result in the person's death
		* Purposefully accusing someone you want killed of being an antagonist with no supporting evidence is considered grief and it will get you banned.
		* Accusing the AI of being MALF or being rogue because it wouldn't let you into a restricted area or the power went off in your room is a shitty reaction and will be treated as such.
	* Murdering someone without proper reasoning is considered being a dick.
	* Beating someone into critical is considered being a dick.
		* If people are actively preventing you from doing your job via theft of ID cards or unique equipment, you may use force to retrieve said equipment or ID cards
			* Blowing up the station does not count as using force. For fucks sake.
	* Discussing the current round in OOC is a dick move
		* Jokes are okay, but we will fuck you up if you reference anything IC into OOC
	* Not reading the rules is a dick move, if an Administrator asks you about the rules you must tell them that you think that cory in the house is the best anime

2. # Act like an antagonist, get treated like one.
	* Breaking in or assisting breaking in into highly secure areas (Vault, Captain's Office, Armory, Permabrig, AI upload, AI core etc.)
	* Blocking off areas with lots of walls.
	* Mass lubing public areas to get people hurt/killed.
	* Blowing up fuel tanks.
	* Exposing areas to space such as breaking the windows in escape.
	* Stealing high risk objective items (hand teleporter, captain's laser gun, etc)
		* This does not mean that the RD is valid-salad if he has the hand teleporter, use common sense.
	* Carrying antagonist gear is at your own risk.
	* Antagonising security to extreme levels
		* Organising regular jail breaks, rendering the brig useless, actively hindering security during rev/gang/cult as loyatly implanted staff etc.
		* Getting in the way of an arrest is excempt from this rule
			* Security is however free to fuck you up if you keep getting in the way of arrests
	* Reading any erotic or non-erotic copypasta over the radio or intercom as any job immediately forfeits all of your grief protection, but only your protection.
	* Catbeasts are the only race with no grief protection, people are allowed to grief them as they please, Catbeasts are not allowed to fight back. If a Catbeast somehow is on whatever antag team you're on (cult, rev, nukeops), then don't kill them.
	* Catbeasts may act in self defense and only self defense with non-lethal stuns or disarms.

3. # Rules for antagonists
	* Do not camp arrivals or any other place new connecting players might appear.
	* Do not kill fellow team antagonists.

4. # This is a low-RP server
	* Humans are meant to have a first and last name.
		* Clowns, Mimes, Silicons and other races are excempt from this rule.
	* Joining to solely play antagonist roles is not allowed, no matter your job type.
		* Doing this will result in an ban from antagonist roles.
	* Do not use parentheses, emoticons, acronyms or post links in IC.
		* No warnings given, you will be turned into a cat and made valid.

5. # These rules are guidelines
	* These rules are basic guidelines on how the Administration expects the players to behave on the server.
	* As you can see, we really don't care a lot, but if you consistently cause the gameplay to be shit you will be taken care of.
